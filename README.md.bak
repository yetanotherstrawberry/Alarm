This app is just a simple clock with alarms.
The application needs to stay open for the alarm to work - you can minimize it.
You can add multiple alarms. This app allows you to snooze for 5 minutes.
You can add an alarm for today if the time you set is after current time, otherwise the alarm will be set to tomorrow.
